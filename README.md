Treehouse Javascript Tech Degree Project Seven- Twitter Client
Many existing services like Twitter, Facebook, Google Maps, Paypal, and Github allow you to leverage their code in your own applications by talking to their APIs. Using Node to connect to 3rd party APIs provides much greater control than using just AJAX. Server-side communication with APIs offers many more options and greater access to data, but it also require stricter authentication methods.

In this project, you'll use Twitterâ€™s REST API to access your Twitter profile information and render it to a user. The page should automatically authenticate access to your Twitter profile. It should use this access to populate three columns on your page:

Your 5 most recent tweets.
Your 5 most recent friends.
Your 5 most recent private messages.

In order to run the program please run the following commands:
<br/>
<strong>npm install</strong>
<br/>
<strong>npm start</strong>
<br/>
To view the application open your web browser and browse to http://localhost:3000/
